# Background and Interests
I'm the first person studying in my family, that's why I engage in the **ArbeiterKind.de** community to encourage first generation students.

A few month ago I discovered crocheting for myself, that's why I'm now accompanied by these little guys.

I also like handmade clay cups, musicals and gardening (succulents and orchids).
